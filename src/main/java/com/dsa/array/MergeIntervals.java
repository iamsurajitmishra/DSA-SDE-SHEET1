Problem : Given a set of time intervals in any order,
merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals.


Test case1:
Input: Intervals = {{1,3},{2,4},{6,8},{9,10}}
Output: {{1, 4}, {6, 8}, {9, 10}}

Explanation: Given intervals: [1,3],[2,4],[6,8],[9,10],
we have only two overlapping intervals here,[1,3] and [2,4].
Therefore we will merge these two and return [1,4],[6,8], [9,10].


Test Case2:
Input: Intervals = {{6,8},{1,9},{2,4},{4,7}}
Output: {{1, 9}}
