Problem :
Given two arrays: a1[0..n-1] of size n and a2[0..m-1] of size m.
Task is to check whether a2[] is a subset of a1[] or not.
Both the arrays can be sorted or unsorted.


Input: 1
N = 8, M = 5
A = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between
maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates
is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing following M packets :
{3, 4, 9, 7, 9}.


Input: 2
a1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
a2[] = {1, 2, 4}
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
a2[] is a subset of a1[]
