/*
Problem : Problem : Given an integer array A[] of n elements. Your task is to complete the function palinArray.
Which will return 1 if all the elements of the array are palindrome otherwise it will return 0.

Test Case 1:
Input:
5
111 222 333 444 555

Output:
1

Explanation:
A[0] = 111 //which is a palindrome number.
A[1] = 222 //which is a palindrome number.
A[2] = 333 //which is a palindrome number.
A[3] = 444 //which is a palindrome number.
A[4] = 555 //which is a palindrome number.
As all numbers are palindrome so This will return 1.


Test Case 2:

Input:
3
121 131 20

Output:
0

Explanation:
20 is not a palindrome hence the output is 0.
